### 2022

2022 is the first year that I have participated in this challenge.

I have set myself the following goals:
- Complete all challenges available throughout the course of the month - Failed :(
- Use a different language each day (or at least try to) - Failed :(

| Day | Language |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Python |
| 2 | Bash |
| 3 | Kotlin |
| 4 | Ruby |
| 5 | Ruby |
| 6 | Python |
| 7 | Python |
| 8 | Python |
| 9 | Python |
| 10 | C |
| 11 | Python |
| 12 | Python |
| 13 | Python |
| 14 | Python |
| 15 | Python |
| 16 | Python |
| 17 | Python |
| 18 |  |
| 19 |  |
| 20 |  |
| 21 |  |
| 22 |  |
| 23 |  |
| 24 |  |
| 25 |  |

I got most of the way through and then gave up - next year I'll get them all! (maybe...)
